### TIME SERIES ANALYSIS AND FORECAST ON BRAZIL WILDFIRES

### Dataset : 
The data for this Time Series Analytics project was obtained from Kaggle Website (Forest Fires in Brazil - Number of
forest fires reported in Brazil by State).

### Summary :
The objective of this Analysis is to compare the performances between Holt-Winters (HW) model, Autoregressive (AR) model and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models on predicting and forecasting the wildfires in Brazil. The performance metrics of models is measured by using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE). The results showed that the HW model obtained better results when compared to the AR and ARIMA models.
